Hi, Iâ€™m @ractoc

I'm interestedi in developing / working on Java projects that provide tools to make work easier.
I'm currently learning about OAuth / OpenID. For this I'm using Keycloak as a central "OpenId Broker".
Aside from that I'm working in Quarkus for the backend and Angular for the front end. Both can work on a kubernetes container no poblem, bt atm. I'm aiming for a standalone Raspberry PI setup for the servers.

You can each me via a PM on GitHub.
